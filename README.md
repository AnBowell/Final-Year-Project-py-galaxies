## General infomation
This is my final year project for a Physics MPhys at the University of Sussex.

The aim of this project is to implement differen physics routines in Python in the effort of creating a Python front end
for L-Galaxies. 
	
The useful classes and functions will be housed within the PyGalaxies package. A driver script will then be used to control the flow of the model.

## Physics-routines
Different physics routines will be added and tracked here.

- [x] Baryon accretion
- [x] Cooling of hot to cold gas
- [x] Star formation and feedback

Future Work
- [ ] AGN feedback
- [ ] Detailed metallicities
