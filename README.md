## General infomation
This is my final year project for a Physics MPhys at the University of Sussex.

The aim of this project is to implement differen physics routines in Python in the effort of creating a Python front end
for L-Galaxies. 
	
THe useful classes and functions will be housed within the PyGalaxies module. Jupyter notebooks will be used to walk through
how they can be used to get a desired output.

## Physics-routines
Different physics routines will be added and tracked here.
